This is a tutorial of a rogue-like RPG, which is of a similar sort of a game i'd like to make, especially with the inventory system, I dislike the moving system, and the turnbased combat, However I really like the discovering of rooms, and the algorithms for the dungeon.

I really like the mechanics of the game, from the randomization of the dungeons, to the random monsters, random bosses and random item spawns, I would like to use this as a small little template for my game, as the element of luck is what i'd like for my game.
